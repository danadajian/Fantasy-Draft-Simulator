This python application uses two packages that do not come with Python.  You will need to install them before you are able to run the app.

Instructions (Mac):
1. Open Terminal.
2. Check to see if you have "pip" installed already. Do this by typing the command: "pip --version".
   If a version number is returned, then pip is installed.
3. Type "pip install requests". This will install the "requests" package.
4. Type "pip install bs4". This will install the "bs4" package.
